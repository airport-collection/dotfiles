# After running this command, content of your $HOME would stop changing.  But
# you still will be able to change it, with all the changed content going into
# tmpHome.  This is useful but it is not suitable for using overlayfs for HOME
# directory as you cannot just keep the changes you want, but you need to keep
# all changes in the overlay fs.
